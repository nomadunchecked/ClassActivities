// Function Activity 1

// Declare a function called testAverage
//  These are the requirements of the function:
//    Accepts a single parameter that can accept an infinite amount of arguments
//    Inside the function, add the parameters together
//    Divide the sum by the number of parameters that were passed in
//    The function will output the result
// Hints: Remember how a rest parameter represents arguments and what methods that can allow us to use

function testAverage(...scores) {
  // We need a variable set to 0 in order to accurately add the current value of the iteration to what the current sum of scores is
  // We also need to save the sum to a variable so we can reference that value in the return statement
  let total = 0;
  for (let score of scores) {
    total += score;
    // If it helps, uncomment the console.log below if you want to see what total is at the end of each iteration
    // console.log(total);
  }
  return total / scores.length;
}

// Invoke testAverage with the following parameters: 92, 71, 85, 83

testAverage(92, 71, 85, 83);

// Function Activity 2
// NOTE: This function really just contains conditionals. The real purpose of Activity 2 is to practice using the returned value of a function as the argument to another function

// Declare a function called gradeCheck
//  These are the requirements of the function:
//    Accepts a single parameter (we will be passing the returned value of our testAverage function)
//    Inside the function, build the following conditionals:
//    if argument is greater than or equal to 90, print "Your grade is an A, great job!" then output false
//    if argument is greater than or equal to 80 but less than 90, print "Your grade is B, nice job!" then output false
//    if argument is greater than or equal to 70, print "Your grade is a C, extra studying required" then output true
//    if argument is less than 70, print "Uh oh." then output true

function gradeCheck(grade) {
  if (grade >= 90) {
    console.log(`${grade} is an A, great job!`);
    return false;
  }
  if (grade >= 80) {
    console.log(`${grade} is a B, nice job!`);
    return false;
  }
  if (grade >= 70) {
    console.log(`${grade} is a C, extra studying required.`);
    return true;
  }
  if (grade < 70) {
    console.log(`${grade}. Uh oh.`);
    return true;
  }
}

// Invoke gradeCheck and pass in testAverage as an argument; testAverage should have the same parameters as before
// NOTE: There are a couple of ways to do this. You could invoke testAverage() inside the argument of gradeCheck:
gradeCheck(testAverage(92, 71, 85, 83)); // 82.75 is a B, nice job!

// Or you could create a variable and assign it to the returned value of testAverage()
let avg = testAverage(92, 71, 85, 83);
gradeCheck(avg);

// Now invoke gradeCheck, but pass in testAverage as an argument that has different parameters
gradeCheck(testAverage(52, 71, 55, 44)); // 55.5. Uh oh.
